    "Suppose a school district wants to understand the performance of its students in math. They collect data on\n",
    " the math test scores of 100 students and compute some descriptive statistics:\n",

    "Mean score: 75\n",

    "Example of inferential statistics:\n",
    "Suppose a researcher is interested in understanding whether a new drug is effective in treating a particular\n",
    " disease. They conduct a randomized controlled trial with 500 participants, randomly assigning half to receive\n",
